## useFullScreen Hook

The useFullScreen hook allows a page or element to occupy the full screen.

Import as follows:

```javascript
import { useFullScreen } from '@nearform/react-browser-hooks' 
```

Example of usage:

```javascript
const { toggle, fullsceen } = useFullScreen()
<button onClick={toggle}>{fullScreen ? 'Close' : 'Open'}</button>
```

Parameters:
- element (object): optional useRef() React hook returned object (defaults to document element)

Returns an object containing:
- toggle (function): toggles full screen mode
- open (function): opens full screen mode
- close (function): closes full screen mode
- fullScreen (boolean): whether in full screen mode or not
- info (object): some information as to why we are in fullScreen (browser specific)
    - lastRequest (string): the request made to enter/exist fullscreen
    - lastEvent (string): the event raised
    - reason (string): the reason why, if in fullScreen mode

See the /demo/src/components/fullscreen component for a full usage example.

## useFullScreenBrowser Hook

The useFullScreenBrowser Hook detects if the user has entered fullscreen using the browser menu.  As this does not trigger any browser events internally, the component must listen for resize events (limited to 1 frame per second), and evaluate whether in full screen mode or not. Both useFullScreenBrowser and useFullScreen can be used together to detect these modes (see the FullScreen demo component for an example).

Import as follows:

```javascript
import { useFullScreenBrowser } from '@nearform/react-browser-hooks' 
```

Example of usage:

```javascript
const fsb = useFullScreenBrowser()
<p>Full Screen: {fsb.fullScreen ? 'open' : 'closed'}</p>
```

Returns an object containing:
- fullScreen (boolean): whether in full screen mode or not
- info (object): some information as to why we are in fullScreen mode
    - reason (string): why we are in full screen mode e.g. borderless full screen as innerWidth and innerHeight are the same size as the screen
    - sizeInfo (object): the sizeInfo object used to determine if in full screen, this is returned so that users can make further judgement as to whether in fullscreen mode or not
